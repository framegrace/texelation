Thank you for the thorough reviews. I have analyzed the feedback and here are my conclusions:

**1. AdvanceFocusOnEnter behavior (Valid)**
The concern that `AdvanceFocusOnEnter` fails for standard widgets is valid. The current code incorrectly attempts to cast the *leaf* widget (e.g., `Input`) to `FocusCycler`. Since most leaf widgets don't implement this, the enter key is ignored.
**Fix:** I will modify `UIManager.HandleKey` to delegate to `cycleFocusLocked(true)` (identical to Tab behavior) instead of checking the leaf widget's interface.

**2. ScrollPane wheel consumption (Valid)**
The concern that `ScrollPane` swallows wheel events even when at boundaries is valid. This prevents nested scrolling from working correctly (bubbling up to parent).
**Fix:** I will update `ScrollPane.ScrollBy` to return a boolean indicating if scrolling actually occurred. `HandleMouse` will then only consume the event if the offset changed.

**3. TabLayout visibility (Valid)**
The issue with `VisitChildren` hiding `tabBar` is critical. As noted, this breaks the `UIManager`'s ability to detect that the focused tab bar belongs to the `TabLayout`, causing focus cycling to fall back to root iteration.
**Fix:** I will update `VisitChildren` to include `tl.tabBar`.

**4. Drag operations bounds check (Investigated)**
Regarding mouse event routing during drags: I verified the `HandleMouse` implementation in `ScrollPane` and `ScrollableList`. Both check `draggingThumb` *before* calling `HitTest`. Combined with `UIManager`'s capture mechanism (which routes events to the captured widget regardless of position), this logic appears correct for handling out-of-bounds drags. I will double-check the `ScrollableList` implementation to ensure it matches this pattern.

I will proceed with applying fixes for items 1, 2, and 3.
