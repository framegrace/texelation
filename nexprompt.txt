This is kind of weird, first, i want to be able to set ANY app as a initial app not just the ones we have a factory, also the
welcomeAppFactory is not the best of the names. Can we make a initAppFactory to be used both as a start and split, and can be the factory for
any app we want? (Or maybe that's not possible?)
