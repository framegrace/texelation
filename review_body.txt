(Correction: The previous review comment may have had formatting issues due to shell expansion. Here is the full review.)

I've reviewed the changes and have the following observations:

1. **Incomplete Deep Copy (`config/embedded.go`)**: The `cloneConfig` function performs a shallow copy for slice types. Since `embeddedSystem` is cached globally, modifying a slice in the returned config (e.g., `effects` bindings) will mutate the shared default, potentially affecting other parts of the system or subsequent resets. We need to recursively deep copy slices and maps.

2. **Silent Failure (`config/defaults.go`)**: In `applySystemDefaults` and `applyAppDefaults`, errors returned by `embedded*Defaults` are ignored. If parsing fails, the application will proceed with missing defaults without any warning. Please add `log.Printf` to report these errors.

3. **Theme Key Inconsistencies (`texelui/core/widget_theme.go`)**: There are discrepancies between the keys used in `GetWidgetColors` and those defined in app manifests:
    - `WidgetColors` uses `"bg.selection"`, but `texelterm` manifest uses `"highlight_bg"`.
    - `WidgetColors` uses `"accent"`, but `launcher` manifest uses `"accent.primary"`.
    - Please standardize these keys or ensure the mapping handles aliases to prevent theming issues.

4. **Registry Implementation (`apps/configeditor/options.go`)**: The PR description mentions a "Create options registry", but `ComboOptionsFor` is implemented as a static `switch` statement. While this works for now, it's not a dynamic registry where external apps can register their own option providers. Consider if a true registry pattern is needed here or update the description to reflect the current implementation.
