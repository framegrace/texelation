# Planning Documents

This folder holds active plans and test checklists. Keep future planning docs here instead of the root `docs/` directory.

- `TEXELUI_PLAN.md` – Status and roadmap for TexelUI widgets, layouts, and adapter work.
- `LONG_LINE_EDITOR_PLAN.md` – Phased plan for the texelterm long-line editor overlay.
- `SMOKE_TEST_PLAN.md` – Canonical smoke and integration test suites plus near-term additions.
