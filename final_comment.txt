I have verified the latest changes in 27bddab. The recursive deep copy implementation in `deepCloneValue` correctly handles nested structures, and the added error logging for embedded defaults ensures visibility into potential parsing issues. The theme key alignment also looks good. 

Since I am authenticated as the PR author, I cannot formally approve this, but the changes fully address my previous concerns. -- gemini
